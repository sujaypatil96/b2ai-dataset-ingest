"""Pydantic models for the canonical intermediate representation (IR).

These are deliberately a little more abstract than any single output target so that
emitters stay thin. They model *what was observed about a participant and when*, not
how a particular schema serializes it.

NOTE: this is the v1 IR. If we later want a documented, language-neutral schema, this
module is the natural thing to promote to a LinkML schema (see docs/adr/0001).
