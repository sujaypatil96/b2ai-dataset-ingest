#
# WHY THIS IS DOCUMENTATION AND NOT DATA
# --------------------------------------
# The AI-READI Data License covers participant Data, including data that has been
# "excerpted or otherwise altered". This file is neither: it is the project's own published
# data dictionary -- REDCap variable names, question text, OMOP concept ids, laterality and
# form names. No participant appears in it. The AI-READI documentation is released under
# CC-BY-4.0, which is what makes it usable here.
#
# It is fetched rather than vendored so that (a) the provenance stays a URL rather than a
# copy, and (b) `data_synth/` remains the single gitignored home for inputs.
#
# WHAT IT IS USED FOR
# -------------------
# `config/aireadi/` uses it for two things the VUMC synthetic release cannot supply:
#   1. UNTRUNCATED item labels. In the data, <domain>_source_value is hard-truncated at 49
#      characters ("mhoccur_ua, Urinary problems (Examples: urinary t"), so it is never a
#      usable label source.
#   2. Items the synthetic release does not ship at all -- the 26 per-eye ophthalmic items
#      and their laterality, and the second blood-pressure and pulse readings.
#
# IT IS A CANDIDATE GENERATOR, NEVER AN ORACLE
# --------------------------------------------
# It carries codes that do not resolve. It gives bp1_sysbp_vsorres `LOINC:2403450`, for
# which the NLM Clinical Table service returns no hits; the real code is 8480-6. So NO code
# is taken from it directly. Every ontology term this repo emits is independently verified
# -- MONDO/HPO/UBERON/NCIT against a pinned release with oaklib (and re-checked in CI by
# `b2ai-ingest validate-mappings --strict-ontology`), LOINC against the NLM service. Use
# this file to find *candidates* and to name items; verify before anything ships.
