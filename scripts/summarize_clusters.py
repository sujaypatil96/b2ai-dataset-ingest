"""Postprocess a clustering run: read `results.pb` and summarise it.

The last step of `scripts/cluster_phenopackets.sh`, which runs it for you. Run it
directly only to re-summarise an existing `results.pb` without re-clustering.

Stratiphy does the clustering; this only reads its output. Its CLI covers `setup`,
`preprocess` and `compute`, but the result is a protobuf and the only way to look
inside is the Python API, so this fills that one gap and adds nothing else.

Two things to know about the file it reads. The top-level message is
`StratiphyResult`, which *wraps* the `ClusteringWorkflowResult` alongside the
cohort and run metadata, so parsing it as the latter fails with a bare
`DecodeError`. And the headline is not the cluster assignment: it is
`split_check`, Stratiphy's own verdict on whether the cohort should be split at
all, computed from the gap statistic against randomised cohorts. A partition
exists for every k whether or not it means anything.

Output is aggregate. Cluster *sizes* and term frequencies are safe to share; the
per-participant assignment is not, and is written to its own file so the two are
never confused.
