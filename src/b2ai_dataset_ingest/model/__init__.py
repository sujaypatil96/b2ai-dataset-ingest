"""Canonical, target-neutral intermediate representation (IR).

A :class:`~b2ai_dataset_ingest.model.core.Participant` is the unit of output: one
participant carries an :class:`Individual` plus lists of time-stamped observations
(diseases, measurements, phenotypic features). Each observation carries its own
:class:`TimePoint`, which an emitter renders into a target's time construct (for
phenopackets, a ``TimeElement``).
