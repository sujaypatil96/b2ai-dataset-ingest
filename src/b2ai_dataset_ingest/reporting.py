"""Aggregate, PHI-safe run reporting.

Silent degradation is the dominant failure mode for this pipeline: a real data dictionary
whose shape the reader doesn't expect, a session column that isn't there, an answer the
ordinal map can't resolve — none of these raise, they just quietly shrink the output. The
only end-of-run signal used to be "wrote N phenopackets", a count of *files* that stays
reassuringly high even when the files are content-free.

:class:`IngestReport` is the antidote: sub-readers and the mapping engine record what they
skipped, merged, or couldn't map, and the CLI prints the tally so degradation is visible.

Everything here is keyed by *table* / *table.column* — never by cell value or
``participant_id`` — so the report can be printed and logged even when the source is the
real, HIPAA-sensitive dataset.
