"""Value-gated B2AI -> HPO rules: load conditional SSSOM mappings, derive PhenotypicFeatures.

This is the *apply path* for ADR-0002. A B2AI -> HPO SSSOM row whose ``when_value`` column is
non-empty is a **conditional** mapping: the HPO ``PhenotypicFeature`` is asserted for a
participant only when their answer to the source item satisfies the condition. Rows with an
empty ``when_value`` stay inert semantic mappings and are ignored here (they change no output).

Two steps:

- :func:`load_conditional_rules` reads the SSSOM files with the column-preserving
  :func:`~b2ai_dataset_ingest.mapping.sssom_io.parse_sssom` (``sssom-py`` would drop
  ``when_value``) and returns the conditional rules indexed ``table -> column -> [rules]``.
- :func:`derive_features` evaluates those rules against one answered row and emits
  :class:`~b2ai_dataset_ingest.model.core.PhenotypicFeatureObservation`\\s. Each derived feature
  carries provenance: a human-readable description and a GA4GH ``Evidence`` with an ECO
  self-report code and an ``ExternalReference`` to the source item — so a questionnaire-derived
  phenotype is never mistaken for a clinician-observed finding. Only **presence** is derived:
  a questionnaire's lowest answer denies the symptom within the instrument's recall window,
  not the phenotype (see docs/mapping-conventions.md).

The loader is **tolerant**, mirroring the rest of the reader: a malformed ``when_value`` or a
non-HPO object is logged (by subject — mapping metadata, never PHI) and skipped, because
``b2ai-ingest validate-mappings`` is the enforcing gate in CI.
