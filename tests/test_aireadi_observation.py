"""observation.csv ingest: instrument items, and the scope policy around them.

observation.csv is the widest table in an AI-READI release — hundreds of item keys, of which
this pipeline ingests a handful on purpose. Two properties matter more than the item list
itself, and both are tested here:

- **"dropped by policy" and "nobody looked" stay distinguishable.** Without that, the
  unmapped count sits in the hundreds and stops meaning anything, and a genuine oversight
  hides among deliberate exclusions.
- **Every published item is accounted for.** A family with no rule and no mapping is a gap in
  the policy, not a silent no-op.
