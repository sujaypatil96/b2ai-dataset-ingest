# AI-READI OMOP fixture

A hand-crafted, minimal AI-READI-shaped tree used to exercise the OMOP reader in CI.

**Every value here is invented.** Nothing is excerpted from, derived from, or sampled out of
the real AI-READI release or the VUMC synthetic release. That is a licence requirement, not
tidiness: the AI-READI Data License (WashU v2.0) extends to data that has been "excerpted or
otherwise altered", so a trimmed slice of the real tables would still be licensed Data and
could not be committed to a public repo. What *is* freely reusable is the release's
*vocabulary* — table names, column names, REDCap variable names and OMOP concept ids — which
AI-READI publishes under CC-BY-4.0 at docs.aireadi.org. Rows are Data; schema is not.

`person_id`s are 6-digit `9000xx`. Real mini ids are 4-digit and VUMC synthetic ids start at
0, so a fixture row can never be mistaken for either.

## What each row is here to exercise

| Trap | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Two leading index columns (`""` and `X`) | `measurement.csv` — the mini shape. The VUMC release ships only one, so the reader must never key on header equality. |
| Item key is the REDCap variable, not the concept id | `bp1_sysbp_vsorres` and `bp2_sysbp_vsorres` share concept `3004249`; keying on the concept would merge two readings. |
| `description` keeps same-assay readings apart | the same two rows: both carry `LOINC:8480-6` after mapping. |
| A `*_source_value` with no comma | `moca_total_score` — 30 measurement items have none. |
| A 49-character truncated label | `import_hba1c, Hemoglobin A1c/Hemoglobin.total in` |
| A censored value (`operator_concept_id = 4171756`) | the `import_nt_probnp` row — must be dropped, not reported as a measured 36.0. |
| An operator of `0` ("not recorded") that must still emit | every ophthalmic row. Gating on "must equal 4172703" would delete them. |
| A refusal sentinel in `value_as_number` | `999.0` on 900003's `import_hba1c` — dropped and counted. |
| Laterality from the qualifier column | `viaodplog` / `viaosplog` (`45876703` / `45883829`). |
| Laterality with **no** qualifier | `viaodsph` — per-eye by name only, which is why the config declares the side. |
| A one-sided reference range | `import_creatinine` has `range_high` but no `range_low` — must be dropped, since proto3 would read the missing bound back as 0. |
| A real two-sided reference range | `import_hba1c`. |
| A scoring range that is *not* a reference range | `moca_total_score` (0–30) — the item is unmapped in v1, so it also covers the unmapped path. |
| `visit_occurrence_id = 0` | 900002's `bp1_diabp_vsorres` — falls back to the row's own date. |
| A participant only in `measurement.csv` | `900004` — must still emit a phenopacket. |
| A participant with no conditions | `900003`. |
| A duplicate condition row | 900002 has `mhterm_dm2` twice — one Disease, not two. |
| A configured-but-unresolved condition | `mhoccur_ua` — skipped, never emitted as a `TODO` CURIE. |
| A condition with no config entry at all | `mhoccur_nonesuch` — counted as unmapped. |
| Fully redacted sex | `gender_concept_id = 0` on every `person.csv` row — AI-READI states that sex and race/ethnicity are removed from published releases. |

## What the same rows exercise in the measurement → HPO derivation

The shipped `mappings/b2ai-aireadi-measurement.sssom.tsv` gates these rows too; nothing was
added for it, the existing hazards double as gate cases.

| Gate case | Where |
| --- | --- |
| A value beyond its interval asserts the term | 900002's HbA1c 8.1 → `HP:0040217` present. |
| A value inside its interval rules the term out (`excluded`) | 900001's HbA1c 5.4; 900004's systolic 118; 900002's diastolic 78. |
| One feature per draw, each with its own time | 900002's two HbA1c draws a year apart → two present features, `P67Y` and `P68Y`. |
| A sentinel never reaches a gate | 900003's HbA1c `999.0`. |
| A censored bound never reaches a gate | 900001's NT-proBNP. |
| The silent band between the poles | 900001's systolic 128 / 124 (AHA "Elevated") → nothing. |
| A per-foot item asserts presence and never absence | 900003's left foot 7/10 → `HP:0002936` present; right foot 10/10 asserts nothing. |

## The protected supplement fixture (`protected/`)

Two CSVs standing in for the REDCap Excel exports AI-READI delivers under its separate DUA for
the controlled variables (sex, race/ethnicity, medications). Same `9000xx` ids, every value
invented, CSV rather than `.xlsx` so the diff is readable; the `.xlsx` path builds a typed
workbook from these in a temp dir during tests. `studyid` is the REDCap record id, which the
OMOP tables carry as `person_id`. Every free-text cell is a `CANARY-…` string, and a test asserts
none reaches a packet, the IR or the report.

| Trap | Where |
| --- | --- |
| The supplement wins on sex over a redacted `person.csv` | 900001 `F`, 900002 `M`. |
| Sex `I` (intersex) recodes to `OTHER_SEX` | 900003. |
| Refusal `777` leaves sex and gender unset, and is counted | 900004 `scrsex` and `genderid`. |
| Gender identity is an NCIT term | 900001 (`2`), 900002 (`1`), 900003 (`3`). |
| The dictionary's wrong race code | 900002 ticks `race___c17459`, which must map to `NCIT:C41259`, never to the NCIT meaning of C17459. |
| A multi-select race | 900002 ticks two boxes → two terms. |
| Race `777` refusal / `888` other | 900003 / 900004 — no term, counted differently. |
| Ethnicity choice `C999` ("Chicano") | 900002 → `NCIT:C209381`. |
| Free text present and never read | `ancestry`, `raceot`, `ethnicot`, `racetrib`, `mhoccur_cnsot`, `mhoccur_cnrot`, `pxhic9`, `dvenvlocn`, `cmname`, `cmrouteot`. |
| An id in no clinical table | 900099 in both files — counted, never emitted. |
| A medication with dose, unit, frequency and route | 900001 levothyroxine 125 µg QD oral. |
| An over-the-counter ingredient (watchlist) | 900001 aspirin. |
| A dose Excel mangled into a date | 900002 metformin `2024-01-02 00:00:00` — counted, agent kept. |
| A row with no RxNorm code | 900002 instance 2 — no agent, skipped, counted. |
| A duplicate `(studyid, instance)` | 900002's second instance-2 row — skipped. |
| Route `888` (other) and unit `18` (other) | 900003 — route and dose dropped, agent and `PRN` kept. |
| A row from another instrument | 900003 `other_form` — skipped. |
| A malformed RxNorm code | 900004 `ABC123` — skipped, counted. |
| One code, two spellings of the term | `10582` as `levothyroxine` and `Levothyroxine Sodium` — the preflight flags it. |
| `ONCE`, which has no NCIT frequency term | 900004 — frequency unset. |
